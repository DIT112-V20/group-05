# What?

A GPS Route Management System that gets the car to follow ‘black tape’ on the ground and if any obstacles occur tries to move around it whilst taking the time of the trip to later to calculate the cost.

# Why?

Oftentimes there are paths that are shorter than others, however, even if the distance is shorter, the time might not represent the path correctly because of obstacles. These obstacles might be very frequent and thus leading to a path that is shorter in distance taking a longer amount of time compared to a longer path.

We would also like to “analyze” paths to see, instead of the distance, the time it takes to get from point to point.

The purpose of this project is to try to reduce the cost of trips. 


# How?

As stated previously, the car should follow black tape on the ground, this will indicate the path. When an obstacle occurs, the car should stop and notify the person in control. 
This will prompt the car to go into “manual mode” in which the person can control the car manually with a controller, it could be a mobile phone. When the car is back on the black tape, it should return to automated driving.
